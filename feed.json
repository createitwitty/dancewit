If you met us in person you would just find us making endless conversations about dance and life and philosophy and expressions….We met in a dance class and soon realized our common paths to engage in viewing dance from a non-conventional perspective. It kept us going, discovering more, and doing a few projects here and there. <br>This is how dance inspired us. <br>The website contains, dance thoughts, articles, stories, unconventional practices, contemporary applications of dance and much more. We like to keep it simple and minimal focused to the generation NOW!<br>If our writing speaks to you or you are looking for any collaboration in dance curation /research or may be just curious to know more about our work.
